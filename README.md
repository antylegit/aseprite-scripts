# Tony's Epic Aseprite Scripts

An ongoing collection of Lua scripts I wrote for [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org) [[Repo](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite])], mainly for personal use.

Just a heads up: I don't doubt some might have already been written by someone else before me, and if so they're probably more user-friendly or optimized. I made these because I think getting my hands dirty and programming my way out of problems I face when trying to accomplish a task is fun. I hope you happen to find any of these scripts useful.

## Scripts:
- **Advanced Trimming** - Provides more control when trimming empty space in a sprite.

(I'll add more eventually)
